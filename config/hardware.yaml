  #USING SERIAL NUMBERS INSTEAD OF CHAINS
  #  Board 0 has serial number 0, Board 1 has serial number 1.
  #  This is convenient if your OS tends to reassign the serial port.
  #  MPF will automatically address the correct board even if the ports
  #     are swapped.

  #For multiple CobraPin boards in a game, you will either have to give
  #  the STM32 boards on the second CobraPin board new serial numbers
  #  (10 and 11 are suggested for the 2nd board since 2 is used by the
  #  CobraPin Xpansion Board)
  #  <OR> Use the chains section to assign a port to a board number.
  #  Mixing these up could cause blown FETs, coils, and fuses. Proceed
  #  with caution. Test without coil power and use the yellow coil LEDs
  #  for feedback.
